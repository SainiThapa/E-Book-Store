My goal is to develop a user-friendly web-based application that simplifies the process of searching new books from the library database. Through a straightforward data entry form, user will efficiently search book details like title, author, ISBN, genre, and language. Utilizing CSS, we aim to enhance the application's visual appeal and usability, while JavaScript will provide interactivity, ensuring data accuracy through form validation. This system seeks to streamline library operations, reduce errors, and maintain an organized catalog of library resources, ultimately improving efficiency and user experience for librarians.

The CSS styling will enhance the visual appeal of the application, making it more engaging and intuitive for users. Additionally, JavaScript functionality will add interactive elements to the form, improving usability and data accuracy. Overall, the system aims to streamline library operations and contribute to maintaining an organized and up-to-date library catalog.
