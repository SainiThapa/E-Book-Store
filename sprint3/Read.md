Hypothesis 

Users expect the website to offer a seamless browsing experience across different devices, including desktop and mobile. By providing three cards of the same design, I aim to test the website's responsiveness and usability in both horizontal and vertical orientations on mobile devices. Users anticipate easy navigation and consistency in layout and design elements, regardless of the device they're using. Therefore, if the website successfully displays the cards horizontally on desktop and vertically on mobile, while maintaining consistent design and navigation, we can confirm that it meets user expectations for responsiveness and ease of use across various screen sizes and orientations.

I believe that our website provides genuine and relevant content, catering to the needs of diverse users such as students, teachers, writers, and general readers. I will know I'm right when we see positive feedback from the market, indicating high user engagement, increased traffic, and positive reviews praising the quality and relevance of the content.
