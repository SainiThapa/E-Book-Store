<h1>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</h1>
<h4>Book written by Carol S. Dweck</h4>
        <p>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck is a seminal book that explores the profound impact of mindset on individual success and personal development. Published in 2006, the book delves into the differences between two types of mindsets—fixed and growth—and how they influence our behavior, learning, and overall potential.</p>
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <h3>Fixed Mindset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Definition:</b> Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities, intelligence, and talents are static traits that cannot be significantly developed.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Characteristics:</b> They tend to avoid challenges, give up easily when faced with obstacles, see effort as fruitless or worse, ignore useful feedback, and feel threatened by the success of others.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Impact:</b> This mindset limits growth and achievement. People with a fixed mindset are likely to plateau early and fail to reach their full potential.        </p></li>
      </ul>
